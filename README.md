# environmental-protection-movement
Hi!

This website documents the environmental protection movement from the mid-20th century up until now.
It's a little passion project of mine, that I touch up when I have spare time.
A live version can be found here: https://creative-stroopwafel-7b4efa.netlify.app/

On the technical side, the site is made with React and TailwindCSS. It was designed in Figma before hand, using a design-first, code-second approach. I use this for all of my projects and highly recommend it!

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
